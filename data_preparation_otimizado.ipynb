        "## Dataset Quality Assessment for Fine-Tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "The quality thresholds are not fixed rules but rather heuristics widely used in the AI development community, without direct support in the original academic papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Academic References:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **\"How Many Examples Do We Need?\"** (Kenton & Toutanova, 2019)\n",
        "   - The research analyzes the instability of BERT fine-tuning in scenarios with \"few samples\" or datasets with \"fewer than 10k training samples\". However, the paper does not provide the specific numerical thresholds of 500-1000 examples as a minimum, nor does it discuss in detail the overfitting with fewer than 100 examples. These numbers are, in fact, community-derived heuristics.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **\"Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences\"** (Ziegler et al., 2019)\n",
        "   - This paper is foundational to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), an approach that uses \"human comparisons\" to train a reward model, not traditional supervised fine-tuning with \"examples\". The research mentions the use of 60,000 comparisons for summarization tasks, which is a different data type and scale than the 1000 examples mentioned. Your original assertion represents a conceptual confusion between distinct paradigms. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **\"Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"** (Brown et al., 2020)\n",
        "   - The central thesis of this paper is that models like GPT-3 can achieve strong performance in a \"few-shot\" setting (with a few examples in the prompt), without the need for fine-tuning and gradient updates. The document does not suggest that fine-tuning quality correlates with dataset size, as its primary focus is to demonstrate that fine-tuning can be avoided. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **\"LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation\"** (Hu et al., 2021)\n",
        "   - The LoRA paper demonstrates that the method drastically reduces hardware requirements, making fine-tuning much more efficient. However, while subsequent research and analysis confirm that fine-tuning with LoRA still requires a \"substantial dataset,\" the original paper does not specify an optimal numerical range like 500-2000 examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Practical Guidelines:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **< 500 records:** High risk of overfitting and limited generalization, as the model may not have enough data to learn the task's patterns.\n",
        "- **500-1000 records:** A good starting point, where the model begins to show more stable learning curves for specific domains.\n",
        "- **1000+ records:** A robust dataset that generally leads to more reliable and generalizable model adaptation, but is not a guarantee of success."
